INTRODUCTION

This service uses the Hyves Data-API. To get started on working with the Data-API, you need to follow a couple of simple steps. For more information see the getting started section in Hyves' Data-API documentation: http://www.hyves-developers.nl/documentation/data-api/getting-started. Note: this service currently only uses the tips.create method in the Hyves Data-API to share items (http://www.hyves-developers.nl/documentation/data-api/methods/1.2/tips.create).

GETTING STARTED

1. Place the ShareKit folder in your project.
2. Add the following frameworks if they are not already included:

	MessageUI
	Security
	SystemConfiguration

3. Register your application at Hyves (steps are described at http://www.hyves-developers.nl/documentation/data-api/getting-started)
4. Add your Hyves consumer- and secret-key to SHKConfig.h like below:

	#define SHKHyvesConsumerKey			@"CONSUMER_KEY_HERE"
	#define SHKHyvesSecretKey			@"SECRET_KEY_HERE"

5. You are done. To actually share an item:

	// Create a shareable ShareKit item
	SHKItem* item = [SHKItem text:@"Hyves service example test in ShareKit by Peperzaken. http://peperzaken.nl/over-peperzaken"];

	// Share the item through the SHKHyves service
	[SHKHyves shareItem:item];

6. For additional documentation, check ShareKit's full documentation: http://getsharekit.com/docs/.
7. Have fun. :-)
